Talk outline (goal time: 45-50 minutes)


overview (******1 min):

x	- go over outline

	- discuss the different modeling techniques

Motivation

x	- show examples of each modeling technique		
		- show photo:  "we are interested in capturing this geometry"
		- show 2.5d:   "Sometimes we want to model the basic surfaces"
		- show 3d:     "Sometimes we want to capture every detail"
		- show fp:     "Sometimes we want to just show a macro view"

x	- give main thesis:  combining these techniques
		- show side-by-side example of these models
		- show the idea of segmenting furniture
		- show improvements of floor plans
		- show removing explosions

	- discuss potential application areas for each one


Hardware

x	- show hardware comparisons (gen 1,2,3)

x	- discuss sensors on latest hardware
		- show wifi map as example

x	- *very* briefly mention localiation
		- show pipeline of three repos
		- show example output paths
		- aligning path to north

x	- show example point cloud

TODO: video of pointcloud

	- discuss probability model for points
		- talk about probabilistic analysis of scans

Modeling Techniques  (******10 minute mark)

x	overview
		- briefly rehighlight the different types of techniques
		- remind audience that these will later be combined

	2D Floor Plans

TODO: good result to show at beginning

x		- talk about background on floor plan modeling, other people's stuff
			- mention common themes:
				- want simplified representation
				- generated from pointclouds (typically static)
				- 2d histogram
				- not really watertight
			- more recent techniques are watertight, but not scalable,
				or sometimes rely on manhattan-worlds

		- give quick overview of visigrapp method, showing some results
			- level split, define area, partition rooms, simplify, extrude

		- discuss level splitting
			- remark we can make this better

		- discuss wall sampling
			- remark that we can make this better

		- discuss highlights of interior/exterior modeling

		- discuss highlights of room labeling

		- discuss highlights of simplification

		- discuss highlights of extruding model
			- remark that we can make this better with more info
			- compare to some other techniques

		- lots of examples, videos, including texture-mapping
			- end with cory299 example

x	3D Complex Models (******20 minute mark)
		- say we have two techniques, but only talk about procarve

		- brief background on reconstruction
			- bosse:  mobile, watertight, but dense and noisy
			- pons:  clean, but not scalable and not mobile
			- kinect fusion: clean, but slow, dense, and not scalable

		- give quick overview of procarve/carving method, show some examples
			- define volume, fit surface

		- octree and chunking

		- forming a probability estimate for each node

		- talk about how we can form a boundary for the model in two ways
			- dense meshing (e.g. marching cubes, dual contours)
			- planar meshing (show Pons et al, victor's, etc.)
			- talk about how we have methods to do both

		- discuss dense meshing
			- isosurface analysis
			- variant of dual contours
			- show some examples

		- discuss planar meshing
			- briefly recap planar surface fitting and triangulation
			- show examples

		- show comparison between dense and planar, from thesis

		- show comparison from 3dv2013, between us and bosse

		- show lots of results:  videos and images, include texture-mapping
			- discuss how planar is important for texture-mapping

		- end section by saying we want the best of both worlds
				-> dense meshing on furniture, planar on building

Combining Modeling Techniques (******30 minute mark)

x	reiterate:  two 3D modeling methods

	overview section by discussing furniture segmentation (go into LOTS of detail)
x		- show original cartoon from overview
			- overview each step
			- talk about volumetric nature of output

x		- talk about background methods (classification of furniture)
			- discuss limitations
			- discuss how our method overcomes these

x		- talk about need to align the floorplans to the octree
			- show what happens when you don't align
			- show how much better alignment is
			- briefly discuss alignment process
				- show how to find vertical surfaces
				- find vertical extent using horizontal surfaces
				- filling in missing parts of walls
			- show comparison between wall sample types and improvements on floor plans

			- level splitting improvement
				- remind audience of previous level-splitting
				- *briefly* show how it's better


x		- talk about recarving furniture nodes
			- more efficient than carving everything at that detail

x		- talk about how both surface reconstruction methods are employed

x		- discuss modeling rare objects
			- verbally mention watertightness of furniture and building

		- show ALL the videos from siggraph

conclusion: (****** 50 minute mark)
x	restate thesis, show pretty result, end
