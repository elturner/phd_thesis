	Carving
		- 3DV 2013 voxel carving
		- everything in siggraph paper about 3D stuff 
			- (save fp for later)
			- (save furniture segmentation for later)
		- expand A LOT on mathematics of probabiltiy
			- explain what's going on with noisypath
			- everything regarding the wedge model
			- chunking of scans

	Improving floorplans with carving  (ch:better_floorplans)
		- level-splitting with octree, improves on pointcloud level split
		- wall sample generation via procarve
		- include optimization of fp alignment
