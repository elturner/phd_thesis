Thesis outline :


	abstract (~1 page)

	dedication

	Table of contents
		- list of figures
	
	Acknowledgements (1 page)

	Introduction (10-15 pages)
		- motivation
		- overview
		- background
		- surface reconstruction in general
		- talk about ICIP 2012?
		- indoor scanning
			- the need for volumetric approaches
			- backpack systems
			- quadrotor systems
		- organization of thesis

	harware description (5-10 pages)
		- mechanical specs
		- sweeping orientation of scanners
		- data acquisition software		
		- time synchronization between sensors
		- background on localization
		- alignment of path to compass north

	Pointcloud generation
		- coordinate system (ENU), units (meters)
		- color by camera via time window
		- partition pointcloud by levels
		- scalability of scanning system
	
	Floorplan generation
		- wall sampling techniques
			- histogram binning of pointclouds
				(with and without normal analysis)
			- unsuccessfuly attempts:
				- extrema wall samples
	
		- volumetric approaches with triangles
		- Eigencrust
		- visigrapp
		- room detection
		- simplification techniques
		
	Carving
		- 3DV 2013 voxel carving
		- everything in siggraph paper about 3D stuff 
			- (save fp for later)
			- (save furniture segmentation for later)
		- expand A LOT on mathematics of probabiltiy
			- explain what's going on with noisypath
			- everything regarding the wedge model
			- chunking of scans

	Improving floorplans with carving
		- level-splitting with octree, improves on pointcloud level split
		- wall sample generation via procarve
		- include optimization of fp alignment
		- include some hia stuff

	Improving carving with floorplans
		- removing explosions
		- merging fp and oct
		- refining furniture
		- representing furniture and building separately

	Applications and Analysis
		- error analysis of meshes to pointclouds?
		- Energy related
			- discuss failed attempt to simplify voxel carving
			- floorplan input for window detection, plugload, lights
			- simplicity requirements of EnergyPlus
		- wifi maps
		- pressure maps? temperature maps?

	Conclusion (1-2 pages)

	Bibliography (~100 sources)
